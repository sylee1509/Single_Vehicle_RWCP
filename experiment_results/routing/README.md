# File Format Description

These files contain the **solution output** for benchmark instances of the **MCARPTIF-TP**. Each file records the result of a single run using a particular algorithm (e.g., GPM), vehicle configuration, and instance.

## File Structure

The file consists of two parts:

### 1. Summary Section (Header)

This section provides the overall performance metrics and configuration of the solution.  
Each line corresponds to a different metric, separated by tabs.

### 2. Route Log Section (Body)

This section provides detailed information on the sequence of arcs visited by the vehicle(s) in the solution.

Each row corresponds to a segment in the route.

| Field Name         | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `Sequence No`      | Visiting order in the subtrip                         |
| `Starting Node`     | Source node of the segment                                                |

| `Required`         | 1 if this segment requires service; 0 otherwise                             |
| `Weight`           | Weight of waste collected from this arc/edge (0 if not required)            |
| `Volume`           | Volume of waste collected from this arc/edge (0 if not required)            |
| `Travel Miles`     | Distance of this segment                          |
| `Travel Time`      | Time to traverse this segment                  |
| `Service Time`     | Time spent servicing this arc/edge                                          |

| `Turn Cost`        | Time penalty associated with the turn from the previous segment to this segment                               |
| `Depart Time`      | Time the vehicle departs from the start of this segment                     |
| `Arrival Time`     | Time the vehicle arrives at the end of this segment                         |
| `Shape`            | Arc geometry (comma-delimited)                      |

## üìù Notes

- All values are **tab-delimited**.
- Node IDs are integers.
- `Turn Cost` is applied before `Depart Time` as the turn occurs at the start of the segment.
- `Turn Cost` is not applied to the **MCARPTIF**.
- `Served` and `Required` differ: a segment may be marked as required but not served if it was traversed multiple times.
- `Dumped` indicates waste was disposed of at the start of the segment.
