## File Structure

The file consists of two parts:

### 1. Summary Section (Header)

This section provides the overall performance metrics and configuration of the solution.  
Each line corresponds to a different metric, separated by tabs.

| Field Name                   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ClusteringMethod`              | Clustering Method                                             |
| `ComputationTime`           | Time taken to compute the clustering solution in seconds                            |
| `K` | The number of clusters obtained from the algorithm                                             |
| `K_LB` | The minimum number of clusters for this instance (calculated by $\lceil \frac{\text{total demand}}{\text{vehicle capacity}} \rceil$)                                             |

### 2. Clustering Information Section (Body)

This section provides detailed information on the sequence of arcs visited by the vehicle(s) in the solution.

Each row corresponds to a segment in the route.

| Field Name         | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Starting Node`     | Source node of the segment                                                |
| `Ending Node`       | Target node of the segment                                                  |
| `Cluster`           | Index of assigned cluster (0, 1, 2, ... ); -1 for non-required arc/edge                        |
| `Required`         | 1 if this segment requires service; 0 otherwise                             |
| `Is Edge`           | 1 if this segment is an undirected edge; 0 otherwise                        |
| `Weight`           | Weight of waste collected from this arc/edge (0 if not required)            |
| `Volume`           | Volume of waste collected from this arc/edge (0 if not required)            |
| `Shape`            | Arc geometry (comma-delimited)                      |
